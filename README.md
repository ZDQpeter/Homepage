# About Deqing Zhai

Good day. Welcome to my homepage. 

I graduated both bachelor and Ph.D degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in the year of 2014 and 2018, respectively.

In my bachelor study, I specialized in control systems and clean energy branches, and graduated with First Class Honour and Dean's List. Besides study, I also joined some societies, such as IEEE NTU Student Chapter and NTU Astronomy Society.

In my Ph.D study, I focused on machine learning and optimization algorithms in the domain of AI x IoT applications: smart buildings, such as energy efficiency and thermal comfort evaluations over centralized Air-Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation (ACMV) systems. I also joined in societies together with research and study, such as IEEE Student, INNS Student, IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (Singapore Chapter), IEEE NTU Student Chapter and NTU Astronomy Society.

I had been joining in Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC) of Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR) as a research scientist since 2018 until present. The reserach direction was focused on machine learning and optimization algorithms over different use-cases, such as in the fields of maritime, supply chain, logistics and industrial production line, etc. Besides the abovementioned, I had also been in academic societies, such as IEEE Singapore Section, IEEE Young Professionals, IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, IEEE Smart Cities Ambassadors, Elsevier and Yaseen Panels.
