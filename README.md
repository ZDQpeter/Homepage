# About Deqing Zhai

Good day. Welcome to my homepage. 

I graduated both bachelor and Ph.D degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in the year of 2014 and 2018, respectively.

In my bachelor study, I specialized in control systems and clean energy branches, and graduated with First Class Honour and Dean's List. Besides study, I also joined some societies, such as IEEE NTU Student Chapter and NTU Astronomy Society.

In my Ph.D study, I focused on machine learning and optimization algorithms in the applications of smart buildings, such as energy efficiency and thermal comfort evaluations over centralized Air-Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation (ACMV) systems. I also joined in societies together with research and study, such as IEEE Student, INNS Student, IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (Singapore Chapter), IEEE NTU Student Chapter and NTU Astronomy Society.

After graduation, I joined in Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR) as a research scientist since 2018 until present. The reserach direction is focused on machine learning and optimization algorithms over different use-cases, such as in the fields of maritime and industrial production line, etc. As for academic societies, I also joined in IEEE Singapore Section, IEEE Young Professionals and IEEE Industrial Electronics Society.
